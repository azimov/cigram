# CiGRAM
Circular Gaussian Random Graph Generator

CiGRAM is a Circular Gaussian Random Graph Generator written in python and C++.
The objective of cigram is to generate large, complex networks with realistic properties such as high clustering,
heterogenous degree distributions, community structure and assortativity.
