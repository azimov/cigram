Generating networks
===================

Generating networks in CiGRAM is straightforward.

.. code-block:: python

    from cigram import generate_graph
    n = 1000
    avg_k = 4.95
    k = 1
    graph, positions = generate_graph(n, avg_k, k)

Here n is the number of nodes, avg_k is the desired average degree and k is the number of communities.
Note that the number of communities here is fixed at 1, so the graph will not generate artificial clusters.

More complex parameters allow you to generate different heterogenous degree distributions.
This is controlled by the parameters sigma_f and sigma_r which have an effect on the underlying probability space for
the connections between nodes.

To generate networks with assortativity this can be specified with the parameter a (by default this is 0).
