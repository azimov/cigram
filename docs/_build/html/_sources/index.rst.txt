Introduction
------------
CiGRAM is a Circular Gaussian Random Graph Generator written in python and C++.
The objective of cigram is to generate large, complex networks with realistic properties such as high clustering,
heterogenous degree distributions, community structure and assortativity.

These documents intend to describe how CiGRAM works, how you can generate networks with it and how you can use the
network fitting package within this project to match the desired properties of real world networks.
This documentation intends only to give a high level overview of the project.
For more details please see the initial publication of CiGRAM:

Installation
------------

Install with pip from pypi
.. code-block:: guess

    pip install cigram

Alternatively, install from sources:

.. code-block:: guess

    pip install -e .

It is reccomended that installation from source is done inside a virtualenv.


Testing
-------

To confirm that cigram works on your system and the build is functioning use the included tests.
These are written in py.test. To run simply install py.test (a requirement of CiGRAM and run).

.. code-block:: guess

    pytest

This should run without error.
